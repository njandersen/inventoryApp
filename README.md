# Inventory App SNHU CS 360
School Project Inventory App
## *Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?*
  The app was designed to allow users to add and change inventory on the go. The client wanted the ability to manage inventory by adding and removing. 
  they wanted to recieve notifications if an item went to zero and they also wanted multiple users and the ability to login in and register new users.
## *What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?*
  First, there is a login screen that allows users to login and if they are a new user to register. The register button takes the user to a new screen where they can
  enter their information and save it into the database. From there they are taken to the landing page, which is the current inventory. From there they can click
  on the cards that display the items and it takes them to the add inventory screen. They can also get there from the button at the bottom. Here, they can either 
  add a new inventory item or update an existing one. I wanted the user to only have to navigate a few screens. I didn't want endless nested screens where the user 
  would constantly have to hit the back button to get out of. Thats why everything the user needs to do can be done from the current inventory screen. 
## *How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?*
  I started off by laying out the design of the screens. From there I skecthed out the functionality that I wanted and began to code from there. This project 
  taught me a lot of valuable skills, especially with java.
## *How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?*
  Anytime I would implement a new functionality, I would run the app with the debugger and see what would happen. A lot of the time the app would crash and I would 
  have to look at the bug report to see what was going on. It's best to test your program whenever you add a little bit of code that way you don't have 
  hundreds of lines of code to look through for the issue. Testing is important because you need to make sure that, one, your program is working and two, the 
  logic you have put in place is working the way you intended. 
## *Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?*
  My design of the app changed a few times during development to overcome certian challenges, or just because the original design didn't fit. For instance
  when I started the project I originally had a landing page that had multiple cards that lead you to the current inventory, add inventory and other screens. 
  I eventually realized that this was redundant. So I changed the landing page to the current inventory screen. 
## *In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?*
  I think my implementation of the room database and the grid display of the inventory is the component I am most proud of. It took me a while to get it to 
  work, it was a lot of new things I had to learn as I went and it was really satisfying to finally see the grid view of all the data I had added to database.
